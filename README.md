# 🌾 Crop Vitals — A Decision Support Tool
### Study Area: Macon County, Alabama · 2025 Growing Season

Crop Vitals is an interactive field health monitoring dashboard that helps farmers and extension agents detect crop stress **before visible symptoms appear**. By fusing satellite remote sensing, in-situ soil moisture, and weather data into a single Crop Vitals Score, the system supports earlier, more confident decisions.



## 🚜 Problem

**Challenge 1:** *Integrated operational dashboard with decision-ready alerts
Prompt: How can we integrate multiple data sources into a dashboard that prioritizes attention 
and supports daily decisions?*

Modern agricultural data exists in silos. Satellite imagery, weather forecasts, soil sensors, and crop models are each powerful on their own — but farmers and extension agents have no single place to see them together, interpret them jointly, and act on them confidently

## 🌱 Solution

Crop Vitals monitors crop health using **seven vital signs** updated across cloud-free Sentinel-2 acquisition dates:

| Signal | Source | Role |
|---|---|---|
| NDVI | Sentinel-2 via GEE | Canopy greenness / photosynthetic activity |
| NDMI | Sentinel-2 via GEE | Canopy water content |
| EVI | Sentinel-2 via GEE | Dense canopy health |
| NDRE | Sentinel-2 via GEE | Chlorophyll / nitrogen status |
| Soil Moisture | USDA SCAN #2115 Tuskegee AL | Root zone water availability |
| Crop Water Requirement | FAO-56 Penman-Monteith | Daily water demand (ET₀ × Kc) |
| Temperature | NASA POWER | Heat stress indicator |

These signals are combined into a **Crop Vital Score (0–100)** using agronomic thresholds from ANR-3180 (Auburn Cooperative Extension) and FAO-56 rules.
Crops covered include Cotton, Corn and Soybean

## 📊 Scoring Engine

```
Step 1 — ANR-3180 satellite index thresholds (raw values, no normalization)
  NDVI: stressed < 0.4 · healthy ≥ 0.6
  NDMI: stressed < 0.2 · healthy ≥ 0.4
  EVI:  stressed < 0.15 · healthy ≥ 0.40
  NDRE: stressed < 0.2 · healthy ≥ 0.3

Step 2 — FAO-56  (loam soil, Macon County)
  SM < 0.14 m³/m³ → below permanent wilting point → cap score at 35
  SM < 0.18 m³/m³ → below readily available water → subtract 20

Step 3 — Heat stress penalty 
  Temp > 38°C → subtract 15
  Temp > 35°C → subtract 8

Final Score:  0–39 = 🔴 High Stress · 40–69 = 🟡 Moderate · 70–100 = 🟢 Healthy
```

## 🌍 Dashboard Features

- **Date slider** — step through 7 Sentinel-2 acquisition dates to track seasonal progression
- **Crop selector** — Cotton · Corn · Soybean with crop-specific stage calendars and Kc values
- **Spatial dot layer** — ~900 sampled grid points colored by selected index (NDVI / NDMI / EVI / NDRE)
- **Field polygon tool** — draw a boundary on the map to calculate field-specific vitals score via point-in-polygon
- **ECG vital signs** — seven signal indicators with color-coded stress status
- **AI field assessment** — CropWizard (UIUC) generates agronomic recommendations from Extension knowledge base
- **Download button** — export field assessment as `.txt` file
- **Season Complete logic** — an out-of-season crop can automatically transition to the harvested state 

## 🚀 Future Work

- Continuous raster rendering (full 10m Sentinel-2 GeoTIFF) replacing sampled dot layer
- Automated daily GEE export pipeline for real-time updates
- Integration of additional SCAN stations for spatial soil moisture variability
- SSURGO/SoilGrids automated soil parameter retrieval
- Mobile-responsive layout for field use on tablets
- Develop an automated data pipeline and machine learning model to support scenario planning driven by user inputs.
