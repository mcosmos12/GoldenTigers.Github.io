# 🌾 Crop Vitals — Field Diagnostic System
### Macon County, Alabama · 2025 Growing Season

Crop Vitals is an interactive field health monitoring dashboard that helps Alabama farmers and extension agents detect crop stress **before visible symptoms appear**. By fusing satellite remote sensing, in-situ soil moisture, and weather data into a single Crop Fitness Score, the system supports earlier, more confident irrigation decisions.

## 🚜 Problem

Farmers in the Alabama Black Belt typically detect moisture stress **2–3 days after** visible wilting symptoms appear — by which point 15–25% of preventable yield loss has already occurred. Traditional county-level advisories lack the spatial precision needed for field-level decisions.

## 🌱 Solution

Crop Vitals monitors crop health using **seven vital signs** updated across 7 cloud-free Sentinel-2 acquisition dates (April–July 2025):

| Signal | Source | Role |
|---|---|---|
| NDVI | Sentinel-2 via GEE | Canopy greenness / photosynthetic activity |
| NDMI | Sentinel-2 via GEE | Canopy water content |
| EVI | Sentinel-2 via GEE | Dense canopy health |
| NDRE | Sentinel-2 via GEE | Chlorophyll / nitrogen status |
| Soil Moisture | USDA SCAN #2115 Tuskegee AL | Root zone water availability |
| Crop Water Requirement | FAO-56 Penman-Monteith | Daily water demand (ET₀ × Kc) |
| Temperature | NASA POWER | Heat stress indicator |

These signals are combined into a **Crop Fitness Score (0–100)** using agronomic thresholds from ANR-3180 (Auburn Cooperative Extension) and FAO-56 soil moisture penalty rules.

## 📊 Scoring Engine

```
Step 1 — ANR-3180 satellite index thresholds (raw values, no normalization)
  NDVI: stressed < 0.4 · healthy ≥ 0.6
  NDMI: stressed < 0.2 · healthy ≥ 0.4
  EVI:  stressed < 0.15 · healthy ≥ 0.40
  NDRE: stressed < 0.2 · healthy ≥ 0.3

Step 2 — FAO-56 soil moisture penalty (loam soil, Macon County)
  SM < 0.14 m³/m³ → below permanent wilting point → cap score at 35
  SM < 0.18 m³/m³ → below readily available water → subtract 20

Step 3 — Heat stress penalty (ANR-3180)
  Temp > 38°C → subtract 15
  Temp > 35°C → subtract 8

Final Score:  0–39 = 🔴 High Stress · 40–69 = 🟡 Moderate · 70–100 = 🟢 Healthy
